requirements:
  - id: "3.1.1"
    title: "Image Vulnerabilities"
    description: "Container images should be scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment."
    rationale: "Images often contain outdated packages with known CVEs that can be exploited."
    controls:
      - "Use automated image scanners in CI/CD"
      - "Block deployment of images with critical vulnerabilities"
    references:

  - id: "3.1.2"
    title: "Image Configuration Defects"
    description: "Images should be configured securely, avoiding defaults that increase attack surface."
    rationale: "Misconfigured images (e.g., running as root, exposed ports) provide easy entry points for attackers."
    controls:
      - "Use non-root users in Dockerfiles"
      - "Remove unnecessary setuid/setgid binaries"
    references:
      - "https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf#page=16"

  - id: "3.1.3"
    title: "Embedded Malware and Clear Text Secrets"
    description: "Images should not contain malware or hardcoded secrets."
    rationale: "Secrets embedded in images are accessible to anyone with access to the registry."
    controls:
      - "Scan images for malware signatures"
      - "Use secret management tools instead of embedding keys"

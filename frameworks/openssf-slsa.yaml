requirements:
  - id: "build-l1"
    title: "Build Level 1: Provenance Exists"
    description: "The build process must generate provenance that describes how the package was built."
    rationale: "Provenance allows consumers to verify the identity of the builder and the integrity of the artifact."
    controls:
      - "Generate provenance during the build process"
      - "Sign the provenance (optional for L1)"
    references:

  - id: "build-l2"
    title: "Build Level 2: Signed Provenance"
    description: "Provenance must be signed by the build service and verifiable by the consumer."
    rationale: "Signing prevents tampering with the provenance metadata."
    controls:
      - "Sign provenance using a cryptographic key"
      - "Use a hosted build service"
    references:
      - "https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements#build-l2"

  - id: "build-l3"
    title: "Build Level 3: Hardened Build Service"
    description: "The build platform must be hardened to prevent tampering and ensure the build is ephemeral and isolated."
    rationale: "Hardening ensures that the build process itself cannot be compromised to inject malicious code."
    controls:
      - "Build service must be ephemeral"
      - "Build service must be isolated"
      - "Provenance must be non-falsifiable"
